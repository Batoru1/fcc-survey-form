# fcc-survey-form

2nd fcc project

trying to replicate this as close as posiible: https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/

so far so good.

don't quite get the html5 validation process, but I gues I'll try to implement it all in the one submit button at the end

I guess the validation just works

the code AS it IS now only with HTML passes the checkbox on fcc site, but I will try to style it with css now, so the page layout looks as close to the example site.

added divs for styling with css

so far no conflict with fcc checker

need to make <input> stretch 100% through my container...

going alot from css to html to make diffrent <divs>...getting confused

seems like it's not the most efficient way to do it...
