# fcc-survey-form

2nd fcc project

trying to replicate this as close as posiible: https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/

so far so good.

don't quite get the html5 validation process, but I gues I'll try to implement it all in the one submit button at the end

I guess the validation just works

the code AS it IS now only with HTML passes the checkbox on fcc site, but I will try to style it with css now, so the page layout looks as close to the example site.
